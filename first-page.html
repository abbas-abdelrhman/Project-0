					<h3>A Slum Area after the Rainy Season</h3>
					<p>My visit to a slum area after the rainy season was a sad affair. The pits were still full of rain water. There was mud all around. The polluted water had caused various diseases. There was no home without a sick person. Small children suffered from stomach troubles. The govern­ment should immediately rush to the help of the sufferers in the slum area.</p>

					<h3>Memories of Childhood</h3>
					<p>Memories of childhood are unforgettable. I was four years old when my grandfather died. I clearly remember how everybody in the house was weeping.Once my mother loved me very much when I had a bad dream. I broke my leg and was in plaster for two months. These and other memories still come on the inner screen of my mind very often.</p>
